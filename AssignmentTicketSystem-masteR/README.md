## Getting started

A github assignment is created and everybody will recive an invite to this, the scrummaster will create the team and the rest of the teammembers joins this team. The team will get a repository containing all boilerplate code.

The repo is protected, so the only way to push to it is via pull requests. So make a fork of your teams project, and make pull requests from this, this will create some overhead, but will train the review process.
